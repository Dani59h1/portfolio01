        <p>
            The responsive site was my first encounter with coding. My assigned style was The 90’s, which is, safe to say, not a
            minimalistic style.
    </p>
     <p>
            To start off the process I started researching by going through pages from the 90’s as well as pages inspired thereof. I
            then created a Mood Board and then a Style Tile to know in which direction I wanted to take this assignment and not
            stray off path.
    </p>
     <p>
            The Hero image was designed in photoshop by creating a colorful background matching the chosen colors, then adding a
            royalty free png of white dots that seem like stars in space. The third layer was an image of mine of an astronaut that
            was cut out, given a stroke and an effect to make it look like a sticker. The image was inspired by the homepage’s
            background. An actual image of the milky way photographed two years earlier in Australia.
    </p>
     <p>
            The theme was my first encounter with coding HTML myself. I had heard of this ancient language from the old bards of the
            dwarven kingdom but never actually tried to understand it myself. However, as an enchantment from a mage’s magical
            potion, it felt natural to me from the very first second, as if I in my previous lives had coded not HTML but
            hieroglyphs in the ancient pyramids. I felt like a nerd back in school solving math equations and loving it.
    </p>
     <p>
            Introducing CSS was the rocket science that would send man to the moon. It was obvious that HTML had only been the
            fundamentals to the new building, the skeleton of a human if you will.
            A lot of time was spent not only searching for my own mistakes and typos, but others’ too.
            I had become the sweet wise old man of the old town, and the townspeople would now come to me for advice and help,
            rather than the corrupt government run by tyrants.
            The internet would also help out here a lot.
    </p>
     <p>
            The final result was not beautiful. This was however never the purpose. The knowledge I would carry on forward to future
            topics were now engraved into my mind in a matter we’d call “Position:Absolute;”      
        </p>
