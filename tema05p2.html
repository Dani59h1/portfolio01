        <p> 
            Having me create a video and take a few photos is the equivalent of having Real Madrid play a team like Randers FC -
            They don’t have to perform their best, will mess around and make a few mistakes, and yet they will still most certainly
            win the game with a few goals.
            </p>
            <p>
            After an agreement with the client on the content that would be said in the video, a storyboard was scribbled down on
            paper to calm the nerves of coworkers. I condone the use of storyboards for videos and use them frequently in
            productions, but at certain productions they are as useless as a filmmaking diploma. This was one of them. With
            experience in filmmaking also comes the experience to improvise, this would come in more handy than any storyboard we
            could’ve made in this situation. And as Werner Herzog, the crazy film director utters, “Storyboards are the instrument
            of the cowards”.
            </p>
            <p>
            The goal of the photographs was to make our client seem like an accommodating person and his office seem like a great
            place to be as well as learn. Our focus was to make him appear professional and like a teacher clients would want to
            learn from.
            The color grading was done in Lightroom and no, my presets are unfortunately not up for sale yet.
            </p>
            <p>
            <u>What could’ve been better?:</u>
            </p>
            <p>
            The light we used was reflected in the glasses, a minor detail to be aware of in the future.
            More light would also have been great in the B-roll situation as well as for photographs.
            </p>
            <p>
            The subject was switching between the interviewer and the camera. One of these should’ve been avoided but was only
            really discovered in post production.
            </p>
            <p>
            More photographs would also not have hurt to have more to choose between. Especially if we were to code the entire
            homepage. However for the final result this wasn’t necessary.
            </p>
            <p>
            Overall the picky client was highly satisfied with our video and has displayed it on his page, which, in the end, is the
            most important aspect to us.
